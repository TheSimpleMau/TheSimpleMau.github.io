        <h2>Who I am?</h2>
        I'm Mauricio Olguín Sánchez, a student of physicist engineer in the Autonomous University of Queretaro (UAQ for its acronym in Spanish).
        <br>
        Nowdays I'm working in learning some of JavaScrpit at the online school of Platzi and to tell you the truth I'm more like an enthusiast in this, but I will try to do the best of me in this.
        <br>
        So, join with me in this looong jurny that just has begun.
